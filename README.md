Due to time constraints, the current version of the app serves as a fundamental framework, and I acknowledge that there is ample room for improvement and feature enhancement. Regrettably, my schedule did not permit the implementation of all the desired features and refinements. However, if selected for further advancement, I am fully committed to investing additional time and effort to elevate the application to a higher standard.

The submitted app provides a foundation upon which more advanced functionalities and a polished user experience can be built. I am eager to receive constructive feedback and guidance to steer the subsequent phases of development in the right direction.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my efforts, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing further to the success of this project.

Thank you for your time and attention.
